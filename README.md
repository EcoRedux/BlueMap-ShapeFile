## bluemap-countries

Creates country border outlines on a BlueMap for a server using an Earth map(DONT USE IN PRODUCTION, NOT WORKING AS INTENDED)

This could be used in other ways; whatever .shp file you would want layered on your BlueMap!

(Have not worked on it due to Performance Issues relating to many BlueMap markers and the issue of excess lines.)
(Feel free to fork this if you think you can fix these issues, Just credit me and the original developer of Dynmap-borders)
